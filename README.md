## 🔍 Insights

- Summer is the most profitable season for flight activity, and campaigns during this time could yield the highest returns.  
- A low redemption rate of points (1.5%) signals underutilization of loyalty rewards.  
- Campaign impact is weak, indicating the need for better execution and targeting.
